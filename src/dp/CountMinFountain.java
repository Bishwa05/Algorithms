/**
 *
 * There is a one-dimensional garden of length N. In each position of the N length garden,
 * a fountain has been installed. Given an array a[]such that a[i] describes the coverage limit of ith fountain.
 * A fountain can cover the range from the position max(i â€“ a[i], 1) to min(i + a[i], N).
 * In beginning, all the fountains are switched off. The task is to find the minimum number of fountains needed to be activated such that the whole N-length garden can be covered by water.
 *
 *
 * traverse the array and for every array index, i.e. ith fountain, find the leftmost fountain up to which the current fountain covers.
 * Then, find the rightmost fountain that the leftmost fountain obtained in the above step covers up to and update it in the dp[] array.
 * Initialize a variable cntFount to store the minimum number of fountains that need to be activated.
 * Now, traverse the dp[] array and keep activating the fountains from the left that covers maximum fountains currently on the right and increment cntFount by 1. Finally, print cntFount as the required answer.
