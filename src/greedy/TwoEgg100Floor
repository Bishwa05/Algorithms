We may make a few assumptions:

    An egg that survives a fall can be used again.
    A broken egg must be discarded.
    The effect of a fall is the same for all eggs.
    If an egg breaks when dropped, then it would break if dropped from a higher floor.
    If an egg survives a fall then it would survive a shorter fall.

Ans:

Let us make our first attempt on x'th floor.

If it breaks, we try remaining (x-1) floors one by one.
So in worst case, we make x trials.

If it doesnâ€™t break, we jump (x-1) floors (Because we have
already made one attempt and we don't want to go beyond
x attempts.  Therefore (x-1) attempts are available),
    Next floor we try is floor x + (x-1)

Similarly, if this drop does not break, next need to jump
up to floor x + (x-1) + (x-2), then x + (x-1) + (x-2) + (x-3)
and so on.

Since the last floor to be tried is 100'th floor, sum of
series should be 100 for optimal value of x.

 x + (x-1) + (x-2) + (x-3) + .... + 1  = 100

 x(x+1)/2  = 100
         x = 13.651

Therefore, we start trying from 14'th floor. If Egg breaks
we one by one try remaining 13 floors.  If egg doesn't break
we go to 27th floor.
If egg breaks on 27'th floor, we try floors form 15 to 26.
If egg doesn't break on 27'th floor, we go to 39'th floor.

An so on...
